Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/janiobachmann/credit-fraud-dealing-with-imbalanced-datasets
Class row 1 indicated the example is fraud and 0 indicates otherwise.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Determined the number of fraud and legit transctions from the data.
Determined outlier fraction.
Performed correlational analysis.
Created dependant and independant features.
Defined random state.
Used an Isolation Forest Algorithm, Local outlier factor and SVM to predict the model.
Isolation forest gave us a highest accuracy of 99.7% which is more than the LOF and SVM. 
Isolation forest detected 73 errors versus Local Outlier Factor detecting 97 errors.
